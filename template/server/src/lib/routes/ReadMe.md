# Routes

## About

This folder should contain a tree of folders.

Each folder should represent a path.

The base route is the part of the url that occurs after the .com, or .ca.

So that is always "/".

The base handler will be here, and any subroutes, if there are more sub routes, should be placed in there own files.

ex
/ route is reflected by the file ./src/routes/index.ts

/manuals route is reflected by the file ./src/routes/manuals/index.ts

etc.
